## AirBNB Seattle

#Installations:
The project is done in Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda). Python 3.6.

#Motivation:
This project has been conducted as a part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. The Students were to pick a dataset, come up with some questions and answer those questions through a blogpost. The questions I chos was:

how to get the best price
how to get better reviews
can a machine learning model accuratly predict price on AirBnB

#Summary
I found that the fundamental driver at costs are what number of individuals a posting can be accommodated. Area is vital and also civilities, for example, TV, availability of parking, Internet and aircon. So as to get great surveys it indispensable to react to each request and don't have impediments on most evenings. The individuals who list numerous rooms  often tend to get bad reviews as compared to people who have one or few rooms. Pleasantries are likewise critical for good reviews.

The best model was Random Forest. It completed a few investigations on imputation on the missing information, including and expelling highlights and various hyper tuning methods . Random Forest ended up as the winner without fail. Its best gauge was a r2 score of 0.65 which implies that the model can clarify 65% of the variance in cost. The dataset contains little data about standard other than comforts, and I trust that a considerable measure of the unexplained variance of cost is identified with standard.

Files:
The project contains a Jupyter notebook where all the technical sides of the project has been conducted, A blogpost on Medium --> https://medium.com/@roaldb86/want-to-know-how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-airbnb-listing-b1a0361330f5 A folder with the raw data and this readme file.

How to interact with this project.
